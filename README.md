# Graph Closeness Centrality Calculator

This program calculates the **Closeness Centrality** of nodes within a graph using **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**. The graph is represented using an efficient adjacency list structure.

## What is Closeness Centrality?

**Closeness Centrality** measures how close a node is to all other nodes in a network. It is calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the shortest path lengths between the node and all other nodes in the graph. Nodes with high closeness centrality can quickly interact with all other nodes, making them efficient spreaders of information or resources.

The formula is:

$$
C(v) = \frac{(n-1)}{\sum d(v,u)}
$$

Where:
- nn is the number of reachable vertices from node vv.
- d(v,u)d(v,u) is the shortest path distance between nodes vv and uu.

## Program Structure

- `main.cpp` - The entry point of the program, sets up the graph and calculates closeness centrality.
- `Graph.h/Graph.cpp` - Represent the graph using an efficient adjacency list.
- `Dijkstra.h/Dijkstra.cpp` - Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate shortest paths.

## Data Structures Used

As required, the program uses the following data structures:
- **Adjacency(`std::vector<std::vector<Edge>>`):** Provides an efficient and memory-friendly representation of the graph.
- **Priority Queue (`std::priority_queue`):** Enhances the performance of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
- **Vectors (`std::vector`):** Ensure safe and automatic memory management.
